Awesome video explaining how eletriciy works. The flow of energy is actually on the fields (electric and magnetic) around the wires, not inside the wires. The eletrons are responsible for creating the fields, not delievering energy.

That's why power plants, generators and theese sort of things are usually on a high height, to prevent the earth to interfer in the fields in order not to create noise or disturb the signal.
