### Measure Theory

"Measure theory" is a branch of mathematics that focuses on the study of measures, which are a way to quantify the "size" or "quantity" of sets. It plays a fundamental role in mathematical analysis, particularly in the analysis of integration and probability. Here are some key concepts associated with measure theory:

Measure: A measure is a function that assigns non-negative real numbers to sets. It is used to describe the "quantity" of elements in a set. For example, the measure of a set could be its length, area, volume, probability, etc.

Measure Space: To apply measure theory, it is necessary to define a measure space, which consists of a set and an associated measure on that set. The measure space provides the context in which measures are defined.

Lebesgue Measure: The Lebesgue measure is a measure that generalizes the notion of length, area, and volume to more general sets in Euclidean spaces. It plays a central role in modern mathematical analysis.

Integration: Measure theory is fundamental to the construction of Lebesgue integration, which is a more powerful extension of common Riemann integration. It allows for the integration of more general functions and deals with cases where functions are not continuous.

Probability Theory: Measure theory is essential in probability theory, where it is used to define probability spaces, events, random variables, and probability distributions. This allows for rigorous modeling of uncertainty and randomness.

Dominant Convergence Theorem: This is one of the important results in measure theory. It provides conditions under which the interchange of limits and integration is allowed and is used in functional analysis and probability, among other areas.

Measure theory is an abstract and foundational area of mathematics that provides the necessary tools to deal with complex and abstract concepts related to quantities, integration, and probability in a rigorous context. It is widely applied in many fields, including pure mathematics, functional analysis, probability theory, statistics, mathematical physics, and even in computer science in areas like machine learning and signal processing.

### Possibility is better tied with Probability Density instead of Probability
